# PyFlow

An event system with type-erased polymorphic callbacks and hierarchical state machines implemented in C++14, with Python bindings using `pybind11`.

## Features

- **Type-Erased Callbacks**: Handle any callable objects (functions, lambdas, member functions) with type safety.
- **Hierarchical State Machines**: Construct complex state machines with nested states.
- **Move Semantics**: Efficient resource management using move semantics.
- **Python Bindings**: Access the library from Python for flexibility and rapid development.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install PyFlow
